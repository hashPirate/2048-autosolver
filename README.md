# 2048-autosolver
a simple game of 2048 and an attempted autosolver.

# Info
- I made this over a year ago as a fun project when I enjoyed playing 2048. 2048.py is the game itself.
- 2048algorithm.py is an attempted autosolver which currently reaches 4096 0.1% of the time, 2048 7% of the time and 1024 57% of the time.
- 2048algorithm2.py is the other version of this project using a neural network with reinforcement learning that was able to get 2048 2% of the time. Still in progress and I will upload it once it beats hard coding.
- Install pystyle for the colors in this project.
- Includes highscores as well as saved configs by player name.
